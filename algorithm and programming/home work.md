## HOMEWORK :

Develop an algorithm which inverses the longest crescent sequence in unsorted array of integers

U can do it with js or python or C , and even if u don't complete ur code u can send it .

### E.G :

**input :** T=[2,3,4,15,16,17,0,0,-4,5,6,7,8,9,10,1,2]

**output :** [2,3,4,15,16,17,0,0,10,9,8,7,6,5,-4,1,2]

**explantation :** the longest crescent sequence is -4,5,6,7,8,9,10 so we must inverse it !
this is the form to validate ur answers with link github , DEADLINE : THURSDAY 7/4 AT 11:59 PM (23:59 ).
IF SOMEONE DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE PURPOSE OF THIS HOMEWORK DON'T HESITATE TO DM AND ASK UR QUESTIONS.
